> Is your Kindle still hiding in the corner and eating ashes? Take it out and wipe it up. Instead of leaving it idle, let it become an ink-screen clock, which is both practical and stylish. Of course, it can do much more than a clock...

# Start up

​		Open  https://1pone.github.io in your Kindle browser now!

# Notice

In order to turn off the automatic lock screen and keep screen always on, please enter `~ds` in the search field of the Kindle homepage and press Enter. There will be no obvious response at this time, but when you try to press the lock screen button, the screen cannot be locked, that is In force. Restart the Kindle when you want to restore the normal lock screen.
